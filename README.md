# Basic-game-loop

This projects consists of a simple demonstration of how a game engine functions. Upon initiliasation an instance of the engine class is constructed given the parapeters width, height and the desired FPS. FPS can be uncapped by entering a zero value.

After the engine is initilized, the loop gathers inputs from the user, updates game logic, and draws the current game state to the screen at the speed determined by FPS cap.
