# Basic-game-loop

This project consists of a simple demonstration of how a game engine functions. Upon initialisation, an instance of the engine class is constructed given the parameters width, height and the desired FPS. FPS can be uncapped by entering a zero value.

After the engine is initialised, the loop gathers inputs from the user, updates game logic, and draws the current game state to the screen at the speed determined by the FPS cap.

Please ensure you have the Pygame module installed on your system before running this file.
